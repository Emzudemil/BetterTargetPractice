# BetterTargetPractice
 
Rotation and Angle Utils from [MightyMiner](https://github.com/JellyLabScripts/MightyMiner/)
Used the ForgeTemplate from [DxxxxY](https://github.com/DxxxxY/1.8.9ForgeTemplate) and didnt changed the package name now im to lazy to fix that

## How to use
1. Install the mod
2. Use ingame the the command `/setrotation` to set the rotation of the target dummy
3. Bind the activation Key in the Settings and and it will automatically shot the rotations you set earlier

Had the code for this laying around for a while and thought it might be useful for someone else too.
